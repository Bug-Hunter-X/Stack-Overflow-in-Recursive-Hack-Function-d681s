# Stack Overflow in Recursive Hack Function

This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function written in Hack. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. For large inputs, this leads to exceeding the maximum recursion depth, resulting in a stack overflow error.

The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.hack` file contains the corrected code that addresses the issue using iteration instead of recursion.
